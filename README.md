==========

A set of utilities for converting *.gmn files to *.tcx files for upload to the
Garmin Connect website.

I have not developed the code in this repository.  However, the licenses allow
for the free distribution of the contents as far as I can tell.  If this is not
the case, please let me know and I will take appropriate actions.

Ubuntu 14.04
------------

The most recent information about using the code in this repository with Ubuntu
14.04 is available at my new blog. Check out the post
[here](http://chrisstrelioff.ws/sandbox/2014/08/16/garmin_forerunner_and_ubuntu_14_04.html).

Ubuntu 12.04
------------

Older information about using this code with Ubuntu 12.04 is
[here](http://livesoncoffee.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/garmin-forerunner-and-ubuntu-12-04-updated/).
However, you should really be using Ubuntu 14.04 at this point, so see above.
