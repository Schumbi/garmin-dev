==========

A set of utilities for converting *.gmn files to *.tcx files for upload to the Garmin Connect website.

I have not developed the code in this repository.  However, the licenses allow
for the free distribution of the contents as far as I can tell.  If this is not
the case, please let me know and I will take appropriate actions.

I use this code to get running data off my Garmin forerunner 305 and uploaded
to the Garmin Connect website using Ubuntu 12.04.  You can see my blog entry on
how to do this here: [blog
